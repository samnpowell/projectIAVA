{!Contact.FirstName}, 

Over 200,000 unemployed veterans are counting on your boss today. In September, the unemployment rate for new veterans was 10.9%. Now more than ever veterans need to see that the Senate has their back. They are counting on your boss supporting the Veterans Jobs Corps Act of 2012.  

This bill has 12 provisions that come from both Republicans and Democrats that will help veterans get jobs. Veterans arenâ€™t interested in campaign politics and inside the beltway procedure. They are interested in getting back to work. That is their priority and they are watching to see what the Senate does today. The Senate has traditionally put politics aside to support the New Greatest Generation. Today should be no different. 

Thank you in advance for having our back.

Tom.
