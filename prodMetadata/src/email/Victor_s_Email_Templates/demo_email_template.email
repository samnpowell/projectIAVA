<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p><b><u>IAVA's mission is more important now than ever.</u></b> The first quarter of the year has been one where IAVA's work has been at the forefront and we are making an impact.</p>
<p>This year IAVA promoted <a href="https://iava.org/people/12413/">Melissa Bryant</a> to IAVA Chief Policy Officer. She has hit the ground running on IAVA's policy position, including pushing IAVA's landmark legislation directly tied to <a href="https://iava.org/she-who-borne-the-battle/">#SheWhoBornetheBattle, our campaign to recognize and support women veterans</a>. This year alone we have added over a dozen new sponsors signed on to our signature legislation, the Deborah Sampson Act.</p>
<p>Over the past few days IAVA has been helping share our communities view of the dismissal of Secretary Shulkin from the VA and the impending nomination of replacements. <a href="http://iava.org/press-release/post-911-veterans-react-to-firing-of-va-secretary-shulkin/">Here is IAVA's official position</a> on the sudden, but not unexpected news. If you haven't been able to see the videos and hear the radio spots over the past couple days, I have linked them below.</p>

  <li>IAVA's best in class research department helps us create and distribute polls to influence popular opinion to ensure that our members voices are heard through the tumult and chaos that enveloped the rest of Washington. We polled out membership on the need or desire for a <a href="http://iava.org/press-release/post-911-veterans-sound-off-on-military-parade/">Military Parade in Washington</a> and a <a href="http://iava.org/press-release/post-911-veterans-sound-off-on-va-leadership-shulkin/">review of Dr. Shulkin</a>. The largest comprehensive non-government survey of Post 9/11 veterans, IAVA's member survey will be launching soon.</li>

  <li>IAVA has spent the month of March bringing our biggest activation to DC, Storm the Hill. Storm the Hill is IAVA's largest activation of members designed to bring the agenda of the community to elected officials.  This is a huge leadership and professional development training for veterans, another program that IAVA pioneered to further tell the story of our community.</li>
