<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>
<p>I wanted to personally invite you to join us for IAVA’s first ever Rapid Response Referral Program’s “Quarterly RRRP Round-Up” via Facebook Live in the NYC office being held tomorrow August 2nd at 1pm.</p>

<p>RRRP's Veteran Transition Managers (VTMs) will provide information about our case management program, Quarter 2 impacts and outcomes and will engage in a meaningful question and answer session. The RRRP team will share insights and highlights about their work as well as information on how to access this important program to ensure veterans and families are connected with the resources and support they need and have earned! <b>Please note that this event is virtual and will be happening via Facebook Live.</b> </p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
