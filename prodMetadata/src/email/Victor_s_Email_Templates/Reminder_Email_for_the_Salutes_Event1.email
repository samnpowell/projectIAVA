<p>Please join Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), along with special hosts Son's of Anarchy's <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000579/bio">Ron Perlman</a>, NBC's<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/wille-geist-biography"> Willie Geist</a> and Fox News' <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/person/h/bill-hemmer.html">Bill Hemmer</a> on May 23--the Wednesday before Memorial Day--to kick off Fleet Week New York City in style!</p>
<br>
Every year on the week before Memorial Day, IAVA members, our partners, friends and supporters gather for the unofficial launch of summer and to pay tribute to our military at a fun, inspiring and very special event here in NYC.</p>
<br>
<p>Together, with military, business and media VIPs, we gather together to hear from notable military guests, enjoy some great food and watch one of the the best military displays of the year: the Fleet Week Parade of Ships. Ships from the greatest Navy and Coast Guard on the planet pass the Statute of Liberty and make their way up the Hudson, to deliver our sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen to the greatest city in the world for New York City Fleet Week. It is an incredible sight to see--and a fantastic, patriotic, educational family event. And a perfect place to bring your kids (with LOTS of room to run!). We'll be gathering at <a href="https://www.piera.com/">Pier A</a>, a stunning setting on the edge of The Battery, blocks from all the NYC war memorials and just across from the Statue of Liberty.</p>
