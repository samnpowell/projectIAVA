<p>Only 1% of the population served in Iraq and Afghanistan -- but ensuring that they obtain the benefits they’ve earned and are successful when they come home is up to all of us.</p> 
<p><a href="http://iava.org/rrrp-contact-us">Here’s one way you can help right now. Tell a veteran in your life about Rapid Response Referral Program (RRRP).</a></p> 
<p>Transitioning back to civilian life can be tough for veterans and their loved ones, even long after separating from the military. Re-adjustment is tough. There are big life decisions to be made. Navigating the VA -- and the tens of thousands of resources that exist for veterans -- can be confusing.</p>

  <li>But new vets don't have to do it alone.</li>
