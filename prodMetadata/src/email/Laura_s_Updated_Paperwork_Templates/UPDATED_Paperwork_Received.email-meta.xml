Thank you for submitting paperwork to verify your service. Since we review all paperwork by hand, it may take 7-10 business days before you receive a confirmation email. Please stay tuned! 

In the meantime, stay plugged in to the community on myIAVA, and check out www.vettogether.org to find (or host) an event near you. We hope to chat with, or see you soon! 

Best, 

Team IAVA
