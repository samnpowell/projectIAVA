<p>{!Contact.FirstName},<p>
<p>I hope this note finds you well.  I really enjoyed connecting with you at TED.  I am looking forward to it being in a new city next year.<p>
<p>I wanted to circle back and personally invite you to Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America’s (IAVA) <a href="http://iava.org/heroescelebration" target=blank>Fifth Annual Heroes Celebration</a> on May 8, 2013. Hosted at the <a href="http://www.mrchotels.com/" target="blank">Mr. C Hotel Beverly Hills</a> in Los Angeles, CA, our Heroes Celebration has proven to be a truly inspirational night.  We would love your support of this great night.<p>
<p>This year, we are honored to announce Ron Katz as the 2013 Community Leadership Award recipient. From his leadership at Operation Mend to his remarkable personal commitment to our community, Mr. Katz has been a steadfast advocate for veterans and their families nationwide.<p>
<p>The Heroes Celebration is IAVA’s major west coast event to advance our mission of improving the lives of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and their families. With thousands of troops returning home and many redeploying, it is critical that we show those who have served that we stand behind them.<p>
<p>For your convenience, I have attached our formal invitation and RSVP form here. You can also visit <a href="http://iava.org/heroescelebration" target=blank>www.iava.org/heroescelebration</a> to learn more about our sponsorship opportunities and how to purchase tickets for the event.  Also, we hope that you can pass along the invitation to your friends and colleagues.<p>
<p>Thanks again and look forward to seeing you May 8th.<p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Paul.<br>
