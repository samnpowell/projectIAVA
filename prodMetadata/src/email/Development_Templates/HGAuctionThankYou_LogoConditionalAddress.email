    <p>Dear&nbsp;<apex:repeat value="{!relatedTo.OpportunityContactRoles}" var="ocr"><apex:outputText value="{!ocr.Contact.Name}" rendered="{!ocr.IsPrimary && ocr.Role == 'Donor'}"/></apex:repeat>,</p>
    <p>Thank you very much for your generous donation of&nbsp;<apex:outputText value="{0,number,currency}"><apex:param value="{!relatedTo.Amount}"/></apex:outputText>&nbsp;to Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) on&nbsp;<apex:outputText value="{0,date,MM/dd/yyyy}"><apex:param value="{!relatedTo.CloseDate}"/></apex:outputText>. Please save this acknowledgment for your 2017 tax preparation.</p>
    <p>We are so glad that you are part of our community, and we truly value your generous support of our mission. Because of donors like you, IAVA has connected more than 1.2 million veterans with resources and community while IAVA&rsquo;s masters-level social workers have assisted more than 8,100 veterans with personalized case management.</p>
    <p>The transition to civilian life is challenging for many veterans, and IAVA provides a variety of programs to help them succeed:
      <apex:outputPanel >
        <ul>
          <li>Programs and resources that help veterans overcome unique challenges with housing, health, education, finances, benefits, etc.</li>
          <li>Events that connect, unite and empower veterans at a time when feeling isolated is common</li>
          <li>A passionate and effective voice for veterans in Washington and beyond, educating both Congress and the public about veterans issues</li>
        </ul>
      </apex:outputPanel>
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps most importantly of all, veterans turn to IAVA when the obstacles they face are overwhelming and quitting may seem the only option. As one of our clients expressed:
      <blockquote>
        “I would have given up in defeat if not for your encouragement. You kept me from that by talking to me on a day when there was just one problem too many for me to deal with. You will never know how much you helped by just listening.”
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>On behalf of every member veteran of IAVA, thank you for having our backs.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>
      Jeff Sigler<br/>
      Associate Director, Development Operations
