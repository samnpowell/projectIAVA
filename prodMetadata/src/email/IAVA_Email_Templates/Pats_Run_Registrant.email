Dear {!CampaignMember.FirstName},

Thank you for signing up to participate in this year's Pat's Run! A volunteer from your area will be in touch with you soon regarding details and logistics, such as how to obtain your t-shirt, where and when to meet up with other IAVA members, and any other important information you'll need before the day of the run. Please direct all questions and concerns to this individual.

We'll see you in April!

Sincerely,
The IAVA Membership Team
