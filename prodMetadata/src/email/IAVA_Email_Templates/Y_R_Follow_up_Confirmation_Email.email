Y&R employees from account, creative and strategic departments will introduce veterans to the advertising industry, exploring everything from agency structure to Y&Râ€™s specific work and how the skills that veterans acquire while in service can translate into a successful career in advertising. 

Following the industry overview, veterans will be paired with Y&R team members to review resumes and craft them to fit what advertising agencies are looking for. Groups will also conduct mock-interviews and help veterans articulate their great skill set in order to land a job in advertising.
