Thank you for registering to march with IAVA in the Portsmouth Welcome Home, End of Iraq War Parade on Sunday.

Be sure to find the IAVA contingent at the South Pond Mill Parking Lot at 1pm.

Please look for the IAVA local leader Kristen Babicki, she will be wearing an IAVA t-shirt. Be sure to tag IAVA in any Twitter or Facebook status updates. 

Best,
Anthony
