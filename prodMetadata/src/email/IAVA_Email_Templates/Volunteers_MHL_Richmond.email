Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to see if you could volunteer at Richmond International Raceway during the weekend of 9-11 September.  We're looking for volunteers on Friday and Saturday from about noon until the start of the race.  More than 500 IAVA members are going to be coming out to the event and we'll need help organizing the event and ensuring everyone has a good time.

Please click on the following link to come out and volunteer.

After I collect responses from everyone, I’ll send out a quick one-page volunteer guide with the specific instructions for the event and we’ll put you into our staffing plan.  Thank you so much for your willingness to volunteer with IAVA and I look forward to seeing you at the race.
