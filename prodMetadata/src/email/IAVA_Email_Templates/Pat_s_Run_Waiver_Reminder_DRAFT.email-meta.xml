    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for taking the time to register for Pat’s Run! By now you should have received an email asking you to complete the Pat’s Run waiver. 

Without this waiver IAVA is not able to complete your registration for Pat’s Run, so please complete it here:

Also make sure that you sign up for Community of Veterans to get to know the other runners on your team and get started training for Pat&apos;s Run.  Sign up here:
