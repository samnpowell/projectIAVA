<![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small; "><div class="gmail_quote">All,<div><br></div><div>Thank you for signing up to attend tomorrow's Memorial Day ceremony.</div><div><br></div><div>Tomorrow will be an incredibly moving day, especially for those who have never been to Arlington before. Section 60 can especially be a very sobering experience. But thanks to our involvement with TAPS, we have a unique chance to really connect with not only veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, but with families of those who've paid the ultimate sacrifice. It's a great opportunity to get grounded to the movement and see all of its impact.</div><div><br></div><div>Below is the timeline for tomorrow's activities.<b>&nbsp;Please note that the report time at our meetup point at Arlington has been moved</b>&nbsp;<b>up</b>&nbsp;an hour to&nbsp;<b>8:00am</b>. It's early, we know, but this is in order to accommodate TAPS and ensure that we can actually hold seats for them, and to get through the logistical hurdle of the tram and security.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>If you can't make this time, you will have to head through security on your own and link up with us at the amphitheater</b>&nbsp;<b>when you can</b>. We'd appreciate it if you made your best effort to be there, however, as the more folks we have, the more we can help TAPS and interact with the family members/kids.</div><div><br></div><div>Also&nbsp;<b>attached</b>&nbsp;to this email is a copy of the strip map, which we'll also have physical copies of tomorrow.</div><div><br></div><div>Here is the overview of our schedule tomorrow:</div><div><br></div><div>----</div><div><br></div><div><b>NLT 8:00AM</b>&nbsp;- Staff from TAPS (Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors) will be giving our group a quick brief on interacting with their family members and kids, how to talk to folks that are grieving etc.&nbsp;<b>Immediately afterwards</b>, we'll move as a group to the visitors center and enter the line to board the tram to the amphitheater.</div><div><br></div><div>~<b>8:30AM&nbsp;</b>- After waiting in line for a bit and riding over, the tram will drop us off near the amphitheater (see map). At this point we'll have to go through security.&nbsp;<font color="#ff0000"><b>Please note</b></font>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<b>you cannot bring the following items</b>&nbsp;per Arlington:&nbsp;large bags or backpacks,&nbsp;umbrellas, coolers, bottled water, tripods.</div><div><br></div><div><b>8:30AM-10:30AM&nbsp;</b>- We're going to help hold seats for the TAPS families that will be streaming in over this time. What this looks like, according to the TAPS folks, is that we'll be standing on either sides of the seating rows in order to ensure that only their people can be seated there. We'll also be greeting the TAPS family members and kids as they come in, assisting them as necessary to sit or grab water etc. Be flexible!</div><div><br></div><div><b>10:30AM&nbsp;</b>-<b>&nbsp;</b>At this point we'll be seated as the pre-ceremony band will begin playing.</div><div><br></div><div><b>11:00AM&nbsp;</b>- The president will lay his wreath, which will not be visible to those of us seated. Afterwards the ceremony will begin, he will give his remarks, etc.</div><div><br></div><div><b>~12:00PM</b>&nbsp;- As the ceremony concludes, the VSOs will be in place to lay their own wreaths (which includes TAPS and IAVA).&nbsp;<b>Note that we will not be watching this</b>, as it is too much of a logistical hurdle to get people outside of the amphitheater and to the tomb of the unknown soldier and back again - especially with the President attending this year.</div><div><br></div><div><b>~12:20PM&nbsp;</b>- After the TAPS wreath has been laid, and at their signal, we'll be tagging along with them to move from the ceremony area down to section 60 by foot. Once again, please be very flexible as this is a very chaotic time with lots of people moving in a lot of directions. Assist folks as you can, and keep your stripmaps handy. If we stick with the TAPS people (they all will be wearing easily identifiable shirts), it should be very simple.</div><div><br></div><div><b>12:30PM</b>&nbsp;- Once we arrive at Section 60, we'll link up with our SUV parked nearby and grab water out of the back; both for ourselves and to hand out to the TAPS families that have made the trek to section 60. After that, please use this time to walk around, reflect, and support the families as you can.</div><div><br></div><div><b>1:00PM</b>&nbsp;- At this point, some members of the TAPS group will begin to head back to the buses. Once again, there is no real structure to this, just use your common sensibility. If you see folks that are especially struggling with carrying children or exhaustion etc, please offer to help escort them back. Some folks may decline, and not everyone will be leaving at once. Use your best discretion and connect with Adam or Jason if you have any issues/questions.</div><div><br></div><div><b>2:00PM&nbsp;</b>- Around this time, most of the TAPS personnel should be squared away. Folks are welcome to stay or leave at their leisure, or stay and reflect at Section 60.</div><div><br></div><div>--</div><div><br></div><div>We apologize for the last minute notice on the time change. We still hope to see you tomorrow, and to spending this important day helping out for such an incredibly important cause.</div><font color="#888888"><div><br></div><div>Adam</div><div><br></div></font></div>--&nbsp;<br>Adam Bryant<div>Membership Director</div><div>Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA)</div><div><br></div></span>]]></td>
