    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for applying to Storm the Hill 2011. 

We regret to inform you that we are unable to invite you to join us in Washington this year. We received hundreds of outstanding applications for Storm the Hill 2011, and were forced to make extremely difficult decisions in selecting a small percentage of veterans to attend. The selections we made were done so in order to achieve maximum diversity across experience in relation to IAVA&apos;s legislative issues, military background and rank, geographical distribution, and so on. 

However, we value your membership and leadership tremendously. We encourage you to stay connected with the issues and other veterans in Community of Veterans, IAVA’s exclusive online social network for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. Inside the community is the best place to learn about upcoming events, connect with other veterans, and stay updated on issues important to you. Just head to www.IAVA.org to sign up or log in. 

Lastly, don’t forget to also check out www.TheRucksack.org, where you can get access to exclusive tickets, giveaways and more. Signing up for The Rucksack is free and easy, and just one way that IAVA and our partners are rewarding you for your service. 

In the weeks and months ahead, IAVA will be activating in a number of ways across the country. From Pat&apos;s Run to Veterans Day, there&apos;s no shortage of ways for you to continue to be a leader for us. Once again, thank you for applying to Storm the Hill. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact our Membership Department at membership@iava.org. 

Sincerely, 

Paul Rieckhoff 
Executive Director and Founder 
Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA)</textOnly>
