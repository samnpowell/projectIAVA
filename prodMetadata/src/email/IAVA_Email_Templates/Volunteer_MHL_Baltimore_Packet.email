Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing to volunteer at the upcoming IAVA member event at Camden Yards.  Attached is the volunteer packet with all the information you'll need for game day.  Included in this is a list of other volunteers for the day's event if you want to get together and coordinate ahead of time.  Please feel free to contact Anthony Pike (anthony@iava.org) as he will be the IAVA staff member who is organizing game day.  Thank you again for all your support and I hope to see you next time I'm in the Baltimore area.
