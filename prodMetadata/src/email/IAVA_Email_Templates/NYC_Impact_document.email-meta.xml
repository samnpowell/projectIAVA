    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I had a quick favor, our records indicate that you attended a NYC IAVA event in the last year.  We are working with a number of NYC foundations to bring more programs to the NYC area. We&apos;d love to hear some comments about what it means to you to be an IAVA members. We just need some brief quotes on why you are a member, what it means to be a member and what you have done with us and if it impacted you.

It doesn&apos;t have to be perfect, just how you feel about IAVA.

Please just reply to this email address if you have a story to share.

Thanks for your continued support and hope to see you at the next event.

Sincerely,
Jason
