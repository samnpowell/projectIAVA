Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

This year IAVA is celebrating July 4th at the Rose Bowl and the ceremony is honoring IAVA. Because of this, we are looking for a few trusted spokespeople to volunteer to come out and speak about IAVA during the day, and enjoy the festivities with their families that night. If you would like to get more information or want to volunteer, let us know by replying to this email or contacting Nick@IAVA.org. 

Thanks!
