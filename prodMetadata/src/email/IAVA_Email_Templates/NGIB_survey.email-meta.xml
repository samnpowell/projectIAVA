    <textOnly>Hey,

Allow me to introduce myself: my name is Ryan and I&apos;m the Education Case Manager here at IAVA. It looks like you&apos;ve visited our site and chatted with either me or another staffer about education benefits for vets. I want to make sure that we are providing the best information and continue to deliver excellent customer service to our veterans, family members, and supporters.

That&apos;s where you come in. Help us make sure everybody&apos;s experience with NewGIBill.org is great by telling us what we could be doing better. Take just a couple minutes (no, really, it&apos;s only three short questions!) and fill out this brief survey: http://iava.org/new-gi-bill-faq-survey

I&apos;m grateful that you reached out to NewGIBill.org; hopefully you received the information you needed and had a great experience with our team. Two minutes of your time will help us ensure that we are doing everything we can for vets like you.

If you ever need more help, or have any new questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly or visit our FAQ page at NewGIBill.org.

Best,

Ryan Weemer
