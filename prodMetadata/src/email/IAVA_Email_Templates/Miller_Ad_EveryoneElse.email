Dear Member Veteran,

Thank you so much for coming out to the casting call for our upcoming advertising campaign. Unfortunately, you were not cast for the project.

IAVA is going to be out in Los Angeles on April 16th for Pat’s Run benefiting the Pat Tillman Foundation. Stay tuned for more information. We hope to see you there.

Best,

Adam
