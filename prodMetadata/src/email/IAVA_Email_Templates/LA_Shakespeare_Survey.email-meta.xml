    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

I want to start by saying thank you for registering for the Los Angeles Celebrity reading of &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; on Monday May 9th. This email is simply to follow up with you to verify information. 

Please fill out this brief survey; it will only take 5 minutes of your time.

Someone from IAVA will be in further contact to let you know if you have been selected to join us. 

Sincerely,
Anthony
