    <subject>Test out Google&apos;s new website</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
IAVA is storming the Googleplex and we want you to be at the front of the line!
 
In partnership with IAVA, Google is launching a new website featuring ideas designed to assist veterans in their transition home using Google’s products and resources. They’re looking for a good group of vets and their families to look at their ideas and give feedback. 
 
In order to get involved, you would need to commit 1-2 hours to review each idea and provide feedback on why you did or did not like each idea. You would have access to test the website from May 31 through June 13. 
 
It’s a great opportunity to see firsthand what one of the world’s most innovative companies is doing for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and their families and to be part of the process. If you want to get involved, please go to &lt;http://iava.org/goog-web-site-testing&gt; so that you can get signed up!
 
Please note that because the website and the ideas are still “works in progress,” you should exercise OPSEC and do not mention this on any of your social media properties or with your friends and family. We don’t want to ruin the surprise!
 
Thank you for standing with us.
 
Sincerely,

Jason Hansman
