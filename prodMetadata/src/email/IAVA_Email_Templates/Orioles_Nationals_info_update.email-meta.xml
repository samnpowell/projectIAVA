    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

You are receiving this email today because we have recently tried unsuccessfully to contact you about a Rucksack request for either the Baltimore Orioles August 9th game or the Washington Nationals Aug 16th game.

Please log on to &lt;iava.org/update&gt; to update your information. Once we are able to contact you we can guarantee your tickest to the game you requested.

If you have not signed up yet for tickets to the Baltimore Orioles August 9th home game against the Chicago White Sox, you can do so by logging on to &lt;http://rucksack.iava.org/dc_RewardDetails?giveid=a0QC0000004EFT5MAO!&gt;.

Sincerely,

Anthony
