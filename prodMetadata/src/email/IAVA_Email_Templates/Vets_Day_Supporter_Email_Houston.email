Dear IAVA Supporter,

Thank you for signing up to support the next greatest generation this Veterans Day!

As you know, IAVA will be marching in the Houston Veterans Day Parade tomorrow. Fellow IAVA supporters will be staging at the Grandstand next to City Hall, and the parade will be kicking off at 11:00 AM. We hope you can make it!

Thank you for showing new vets you've got their back,

Adam
