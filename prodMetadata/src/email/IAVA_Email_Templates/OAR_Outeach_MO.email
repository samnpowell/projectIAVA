We have one spot open for the O.A.R concert on July 14th in Kansas City, MO. You will receive two tickets for you to pick up on will call for you and your guest. We had a last minute cancellation and the names are due today so that is why we are doing it this way. The first person to send an email to nick@iava.org, will get the tickets.

Thanks!
