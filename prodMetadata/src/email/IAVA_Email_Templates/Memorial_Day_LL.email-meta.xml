    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for volunteering your time to help with IAVA this Memorial Day.

If you havenâ€™t already, please contact your local cemetery to verify the times and dates are correct. Also, please fill out this form&lt;http://iava.org/memorial-day-ceremony-information&gt;; it should only take a couple of minutes. 

If you have any questions at all please contact me as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Anthony
