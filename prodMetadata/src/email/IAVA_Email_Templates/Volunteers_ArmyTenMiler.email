Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to see if you could volunteer at the Army Ten Miler this weekend on 7 or 8 October.  We're looking for volunteers on Friday and Saturday between 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.  Hundreds of service members and civilians will attend this expo and it's a great opportunity to represent the organization and network in the D.C. area.
   
Please click on the following link to come out and volunteer.

After I collect responses from everyone, I’ll send out a quick one-page volunteer guide with the specific instructions for the event and we’ll put you into our staffing plan.  Thank you so much for your willingness to volunteer with IAVA.
