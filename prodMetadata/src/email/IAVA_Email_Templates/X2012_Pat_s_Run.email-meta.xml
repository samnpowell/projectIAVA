    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for running with Team IAVA in the 2012 Pat&apos;s Run and Pat&apos;s Run shadow runs.

Whether you are running for competition, camaraderie, or in remembrance of someone, I wish you all the best of luck.

Being a member of Team IAVA, you will be running in unison with hundreds of other IAVA members. Help show your support of Team IAVA by including @IAVA in your tweets and tagging IAVA in your Facebook posts and photos. We&apos;ll do our best to share them through our properties - and give you credit!

Also, if you have any photos you would like to share, please send those to us at Patsrun@iava.org. 

Thank you and good luck!

Sincerely,
Anthony
