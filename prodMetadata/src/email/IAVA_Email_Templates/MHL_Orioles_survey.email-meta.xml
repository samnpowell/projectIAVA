    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

On behalf of myself, the Membership team, and all of the IAVA staff, thank you for attending the August 9th Baltimore Orioles game as part of IAVA and Miller High Life&apos;s &quot;Give a Veteran a Piece of the High Life&quot; program.

The night was a home run for veterans and their guests, as we brought together nearly 1,000 veterans and their families for a memorable night of baseball! Although the Orioles couldn&apos;t beat the White Sox we sincerely hope you, your friends and your family enjoyed the event. Your feedback is critical to the success of these events, and I would appreciate if you could take a few minutes to fill out a survey about your High Life Experience by logging on to &lt;http://iava.org/baltimore-orioles-survey&gt;. By filling out the survey you will be helping IAVA improve future events.

Sincerely,

Anthony

P.S. If you took any pictures at the game that you are willing to share, please send those to Rucksack@iava.org or be sure to tag IAVA in your photo albums on Facebook!
