    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

It has been a while since IAVA was last in the San Francisco area and I wanted to hear from you. Recently you participated in an event with IAVA and we are looking to hear how that has impacted you - or how it has generally impacted you over the years. Whether it was running in the Pat&apos;s Run shadow run in the Presido, being a part of our focus group with IDEO, or sharing your thoughts of IAVA with us at breakfast. I would appreciate it if you could respond to me quickly.

Sincerely,

Jason
