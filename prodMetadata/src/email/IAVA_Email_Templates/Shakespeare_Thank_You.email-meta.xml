    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for participating in the Simply Shakespeare performance on Monday night! We hope you had a great time and appreciate you representing IAVA and the 2.2 million veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

If you have any stories or photos to share from the event, we would love to see them! You can send them as an attachment in a reply to this email or feel free to upload them to Facebook, Twitter or Community of Veterans and shoot us a link. 

Do you have friends who are OEF/OIF veterans and aren’t members of IAVA, yet? Encourage them to sign up &lt;http://iavaonline.org/form&gt; — membership is free and they’ll get access to IAVA’s exclusive online Community of Veterans and the opportunity to request rewards through The Rucksack. 

We look forward to seeing you at another IAVA event soon!

Thank you for standing with us.

Sincerely,
Adam
