Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for RSVP’ing for IAVA’s event on the Emerald Hornblower on Thursday, May 8th.

Unfortunately due to an overwhelming number of requests and a limited capacity on the boat, you have been added to the wait list.

If we receive any cancellations and are able to offer you a spot on the boat, we will be in touch.

Thanks for being a part of the movement.

Team IAVA
