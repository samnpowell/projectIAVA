{!Contact.FirstName},

I am happy to see that there are so many who feel the same way I do.  I look forward to marching with you!  Many veterans have asked some basic questions, so I would like to make some details clear.  The route runs from the Carl T Hayden Medical Center (7th Street) to Bethany Home Road for a total of 2.5 miles.  I'd like to reiterate that the meeting time is 0830, but I highly advise you  plan to arrive at 0800, to account for parking time and other logistical concerns.  Several news stations will be conducting short interviews and live shots at 0820.  Lastly, parking passes will be required.  They are attached to this email, and can be found at the following link, towards the middle of the page and the top of the gray box:  http://www.phoenix.va.gov/news/parade.asp

Looking forward to seeing you there!
