    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We’re storming the Hill in March. Want to join us? Click here to apply, http://iava.org/storm-hill-application-0?tfa_HiddenField=Tier2.

This fall, we had a huge victory for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans – passage of Vow to Hire Heroes Act. This landmark piece of legislation will help the more than 200,000 new veterans who are struggling to find work. And it couldn’t have happened without the efforts of all of our members over the past year. Following on the heels of this success we will once again be knocking on the doors of Congress, the White House, the DoD, and the VA in our annual Storm the Hill campaign with our message that veterans must remain a top priority for our nation’s lawmakers.

From March 24th through the 31st of this year, we will bring two-dozen Iraq and Afghanistan veterans from across the country to Washington, D.C. to meet with more than 100 Congressional offices and to present our policy priorities for 2012.

Last night, we sent an email inviting our members to apply to be a part of Storm the Hill. You have been a consistent leader in our community and we wanted to let you know in advance that we hope you will apply to join us in March. It is your to exemplary service and story that will galvanize policymakers in Washington and communities across the country to act. And throughout the week, we’ll provide you with the training and tools to maximize your potential. 

If you are chosen to attend Storm the Hill in Washington, you&apos;ll receive a free trip to Washington, hotel accommodations, and reimbursement for food and other expenses. We understand that the time commitment is significant, and we expect everyone to be here for the whole week, so we offer participants a daily stipend in addition to the expenses we pay on your behalf.

Join us for Storm the Hill and help us show all veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan that we&apos;ve got their back. Click here to apply, http://iava.org/storm-hill-application-0?tfa_HiddenField=Tier2.

We hope you apply to be a part of Storm the Hill 2012 team.

Best,

Jason
