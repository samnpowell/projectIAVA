I had a quick favor, our records indicate that you attended the Baltimore Orioles game last summer.  We are working with a local Baltimore foundation to bring more programs to the Baltimore area.  We&apos;d love to hear some comments about what it means to you to be an IAVA members. We just need some brief quotes on why you are a member, what it means to be a member and what you have done with us and if it impacted you.

It doesn&apos;t have to be perfect, we just need something kind of quick - we are looking to get comments in by 2pm today. I understand if you are not able to, because this is a last minute request.

Please just reply to this email address if you have a story to share. Thanks!

Thanks for your continued support.

Sincerely,
Jason
