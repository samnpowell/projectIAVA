    <subject>Your IAVA political landscape - DO NOT FORWARD</subject>
    <textOnly>All,

Happy Tuesday!

I want to thank all of you for getting back to me your personal statements. It is something new we are trying out this year.

The IAVA offices are busy getting ready for Storm the Hill and I have been busy prepping everybody&apos;s travel arrangements. For most of you this involves flying on Southwest Airlines. I have put all your itineraries and travel vouchers in the mail, please notify me if you have not received these by Wednesday, March 13th. For those of you in the tri-state area you will be receiving your travel information by email.

Here&apos;s your dose of politics for this week. This is a weekly email that our DC office puts together to lay out the political climate. Please remember that this is an internal IAVA document and is not meant to be shared, so please do not share or forward this document.

I&apos;ll be in contact again this week with more information for all of you. I hope that you are excited and ready to help us Storm the Hill. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sequestration is In: Day 3
On Friday, Congress blew through the deadline for ending sequestration, meaning that the automatic, across-the-board cuts are now going into effect. Congress remained locked on the same issues. Republicans want to focus on cutting spending while Democrats insist on both spending cuts and raising revenue. Despite a few attempts, Congress was unable to find a deal.

While veterans&apos; benefits are supposedly &quot;off the table,&quot; sequestration will have a big impact on veterans and we&apos;re still learning more about what the impact will be exactly. For instance:

Around 30 percent of our members work for the federal government. And, the DoD recently reported that 44 percent of their civilian employees are veterans. By cutting jobs and implementing furloughs on government employees, veterans will be impacted.
Programs that aren&apos;t housed at the VA, such as the Department of Labor, will be impacted.
Many family readiness and other support programs will be cut.

For more, read this blog by our very own Christina Roof.

End of Continuing Resolution on Mar. 27th is the next fiscal &quot;crisis.&quot;
Because Congress has been unable to pass a budget over the last year, Congress is currently running on a series of continuing resolutions that have funded the government for short bursts of time. On March 27th, the Continuing Resolution that currently funds the government will run out. Congress is pretty fatigued by the same debate, so there is a chance they finally come together on some sort of deal. The stakes are pretty high, if Congress blows through yet another deadline, the government will shut down, which will have a huge impact on the ability of deliver benefits to veterans.

Hagel Confirmed Last Week:
Last week, the Senate confirmed Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel. In what was a mostly partisan vote, Secretary Hagel now moves to the Pentagon where he will meet this week with Israel Defense Chief Ehud Barak.

Unemployment numbers come out on Friday:
On Friday, the unemployment numbers will come out for February. The media may try to connect the numbers to sequestration, but the March numbers will have a deeper look at the impact of sequestration.

On the Hill this week:

Other VSOs will present their legislative priorities to two joint sessions of the Senate and House Veteran Affairs Committees on Mar. 5th and 6th.
On Mar. 6th, the House Committee on Veterans Affairs will hold a hearing on wait times at the VA.


Sincerely,
Anthony
