    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I am writing today to let you know that IAVA had to reissue a series of member numbers. Your membership number is one that has been affected and I wanted to quickly inform you of your new member number:

Your new member number is {!Contact.Membership_ID__c}.

As a reminder, your member number allows you to access the Rucksack. If you are not familiar the Rucksack is where you can find exclusive deals and giveaways for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans.

If you have any questions please email the membership team at membership@iava.org.

Thanks,
Jason
