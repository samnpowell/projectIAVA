Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

On behalf of IAVA, I'm writing to apologize that we are not able to confirm your RSVP for IAVA's event on the Emerald Hornblower in San Diego on Thursday, May 8th.
 
Due to an overwhelming number of RSVPs and a limited capacity on the boat, unfortunately, we are not able to have you join us for this event.
 
We hope to see you at another event soon -- and hope that you'll join us at our upcoming VetTogether in June.

Team IAVA
