    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for joining IAVA.  As a part of IAVA, you&apos;re a part of so much more - our movement is growing, and we&apos;re glad to have you as part of it!

As a member of IAVA you will have the opportunity to:
• Attend and Host a VetTogether: VetTogethers are monthly gatherings of veterans, family members and supporters across the country, and provide a number of fun and unique ways to get connected.  You can see more at www.vettogethers.org .
• Be sure to stay connected.  Hang out with us online at Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
• Be a part of our advocacy program such as Storm the Hill, which brings the stories of 2.6+ million veterans to lawmakers in D.C.

Also, stay tuned for new and exciting opportunities that we&apos;re working on to make your member experience even better!

If you have any questions please let us know at membership@iava.org.

Look forward to seeing you soon.

Best,


Paul Rieckhoff
