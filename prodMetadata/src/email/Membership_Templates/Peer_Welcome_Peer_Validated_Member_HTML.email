<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}</p>

<p>Welcome to the IAVA family! Here are two things you’ll want to do right away:</p>

<p>1. Dig through <a href="http://rucksack.iava.org/">The Rucksack,</a> a giveaway portal exclusively for our members--with free tickets to baseball/football games, concerts, you name it. (Check your email for your temporary password.)</p>

<p>2. Join the dynamic veteran conversation on our constantly updating <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IAVA.org">Facebook</a>,</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/iava">Twitter,</a> <a href="http://instagram.com/newvets">Instagram,</a> or <a href="http://vettogethers.org/">Tumblr</a> pages. The discussion online is as lively as your old unit's squad bay.</p>

<p>As an IAVA member, you’re part of a movement committed to improving the lives of veterans and their families – a community that works together and gets results.</p>

<p>Glad to have you onboard!</p>


<p>Best, </p>
