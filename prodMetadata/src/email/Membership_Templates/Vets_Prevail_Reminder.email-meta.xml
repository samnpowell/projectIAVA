Now that the holidays are behind us all, I&apos;d like to remind you about IAVA&apos;s partnership with Vets Prevail.

We are looking to you, a member at IAVA, to help test this new innovative online program. It is quick, easy, and you could even earn $150 for your time and participation.

If you&apos;ve already signed up we would encourage you to check your email, including SPAM folders, for important information from the Vets Prevail team.  And if you haven&apos;t heard from them in a while feel free to reply to this email, and we&apos;ll put you back in touch.

As a reminder, once you register you only have one month to complete the program so don&apos;t delay. Visit - http://iava.org/vetsprevail.

This is a one-of-a-kind program and opportunity and we don&apos;t want anyone to miss out.

Happy New Year,

Jason
