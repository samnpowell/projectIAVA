    <textOnly>Hey Beta Squad Leaders!

Hope you are doing well. I wanted to check in with some next steps and action items following our info call a few weeks ago.

Google+ Community
If you haven&apos;t already, please join the Google+ Community for our Squad Leader Beta. This is the platform where we&apos;ll be exchanging ideas and building our vision.  You can join Google+ here: https://plus.google.com.  Once you have joined, please shoot me a message letting me know that you are signed up so I can send you the community invitation.  You’ll miss out on a ton of information if you don’t sign up, so please get connected!

Building Your Squad
Next week, we’ll be hosting a webinar to go over 5 Steps to Building Your Squad, Building Community Partnerships, and our Veterans Crisis Line partnership.  In true BETA form, we are testing a webinar platform, so we’ll be straying from our normal phone call scenario, and asking you to tune in to the webinar. There will be a form on the page in which you can submit questions in real time. The perk of this, is that if you can’t sign on live for the webinar, it will be recorded so you can watch it after the fact. The webinar will be held Wednesday, August 21st at 5pm - (appx.) 7pm EST and can be found by clicking on this link: http://iava.org/squad-leader-training-session-1 That’s right. Just follow the link at the time of the webinar and you will be able to watch live!

T-Shirt Contest
Have you seen this yet? http://iava.org/tshirt In true member engagement fashion, we’re putting our brand in the hands of our supporters - to create our official IAVA t-shirt for 2014!  The grand prize is pretty cool, and we’d LOVE to have our Squad Leaders spread the word to their networks, to get people involved in creating designs.  The more awesome entries, the better. Once the entry period ends, we’ll be putting the top designs up for vote, so that our members can decide on the next IAVA t-shirt. Please help us spread the word!

Local Facebook Groups
Many of you have asked how you can get your local vets connected up with IAVA, and start building the community. Well, local IAVA Facebook groups is one great way, and we want to encourage you to start forming those communities.  Take a look at what Jeff Hensley created for DFW: https://www.facebook.com/groups/iava.dallas.ftworth We also have an IAVA Florida Facebook group, and an IAVA Indiana Facebook page.  We’d love to have more!  I’ll be creating a page on our website with hyperlinks to all of the local pages so that members can find you all and start getting connected. HUGE CAVEAT: Since it doesn’t make sense to have 14 IAVA California Facebook groups, please email me BEFORE creating a page, if you are interested, so we can be sure we are not duplicating efforts.

There’s a lot more coming down the pipe that I am excited to share, but for now, I hope this helps you on your way.  Looking forward to working with all of you. As always, please don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions.

Best,
