In the mood for some good food and good company?

We’re having a VetTogether. Come meet other veterans from the LA area. Grab some food with other veterans and IAVA’s founder and CEO Paul Rieckoff.

We’ll be at El Compadre in downtown LA this Thursday, June 19th at 7:30 PM!

Hope to see you in LA tomorrow.

Best,

Jason
